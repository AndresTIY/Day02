    <h3>Example 5 (7/19)</h3>

    <div class="static">
      <p>static is the default value. An element with position: static; is not positioned in any special way. A static element is said to be not positioned and an element with its position set to anything else is said to be positioned.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="relative1">
      <p>relative behaves the same as static unless you add some extra properties.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="relative2">
      <p>Setting the top, right, bottom, and left properties of a relatively-positioned element will cause it to be adjusted away from its normal position. Other content will not be adjusted to fit into any gap left by the element.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="fixed">
      <p>a fixed element is positioned relative to the viewport
      which means it always stays in the same place even if the page is scrolled.
    As with relative, top, right, left, bottom properties are used. A fixed
  element does not leave a gap in the page where it would normall have been located.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="relative0">
      <p>This element is relatively-positioned. If this element was
      position: static; its absoltely-positioned child would escape
    and would be positioned relative to the document body. </p>
    <p>this page totally hurts my eyes</p>
    </div>

    <div class="absolute">
      <p>This element is absoltely-positioned. It's positioned relative to it's parent.</p>
    </div>
